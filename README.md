# Aproximation

Problem source: http://www.infoarena.ro/problema/secv3

There are given 2 natural numbers arrays with the same amount of elements. The program must determine a value V equal to (a1[i1] + a1[i1 + 1] + ... + a1[i1 + m]) / (a2[i1] + a2[i1 + 1] + ... + a2[i1 + m]) where i1 is an index between 0 and N(the number of elemnets in the arrays), m is a value between L and U(2 numbers given as input) and a1, a2 are the given arrays.

Input format example:

(The first 3 numbers represent N, L, U.)

5 1 2

1 1 3 2 5 <- a1

4 2 5 3 6 <- a2
